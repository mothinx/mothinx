# Work.

ðŸ§¾ My full curriculum vitae is available on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julien-gracia/)  

I am in the IT field for more than 8 years. I started as a network engineer to become for 3 years a software engineer.  
I have seen a lot of technologies: Cisco/Alcatel network equipments, operating systems, scripting languages, programming languages...
The switch to software development was very important for me as i code almost every day since my childhood.  
I had to know how it works behind the scenes.
